## Hi, I'm Seong.

I am an applied mathematics student, with research focus in machine learning. I have done various research related to deep learning, speeding up backpropagation using matrix and tensor calculus, language modeling, and so on. Coming from a math background, I have a deep understanding of linear algebra, matrix calculus, real analysis, and probability theory, and how they apply to deep learning and other machine learning algorithms.

### Projects

This github repository contains many of the work I have done during school and personal/collaborated research. I've organized these projects into different categories [here](https://github.com/seon9cho/seon9cho/blob/main/Projects.md).

[comment]: <> (One of my new year's resolution for 2025 is to commit at least one change to this github repo everyday, no exceptions. Hopefully this way, by the end of this year, this repository can turn into a portfolio that contains all of my past and present works.)
