## Hi, I'm Seong 👋

I am an applied mathematics student with a strong research focus on machine learning. My work spans various areas of deep learning, including accelerating backpropagation through matrix and tensor calculus, language modeling, and more. With a solid foundation in mathematics, I have a deep understanding of linear algebra, matrix calculus, real analysis, and probability theory, as well as their applications in deep learning and other machine learning algorithms.

### 💻 Experience  
I have been an Instructor at BYU since 2021, teaching calculus and an online linear algebra coding course in Python. Prior to this, I worked as a machine learning engineer intern at Pulse Labs from 2020 to 2021, where I analyzed voice assistant query data for Alexa and Google Assistant to improve user experiences. In 2018, I was a machine learning research intern at Cobalt Speech, where I trained ASR models for air traffic control drones and significantly improved performance. From 2015 to 2020, I worked as a research assistant at BYU, developing ML models for language encoding, finding eigenvalues, and earthquake prediction.

[comment]: <> (One of my new year's resolution for 2025 is to commit at least one change to this github repo everyday, no exceptions. Hopefully this way, by the end of this year, this repository can turn into a portfolio that contains all of my past and present works.)

[comment]: <> (March 16 2025 I haven't been very dilligent in making good progress in updating my github the past couple weeks. Starting tomorrow, I will make it a priority again.)
