## Hi, I'm Seong 👋

I’m a machine learning researcher and applied mathematician with experience bridging academic research and real-world AI applications. My work spans natural language processing, conversational AI, speech technologies, and generative modeling, with a strong foundation in applied mathematics (linear algebra, matrix calculus, probability theory, numerical analysis). I enjoy tackling complex problems at the intersection of theory and practice, from optimizing backpropagation methods to designing novel neural network architectures.

***

### 💻 Experience  
**Graduate Researcher, ML Research Group (BYU)** – led projects on accelerating backpropagation, novel language modeling approaches, and unsupervised source separation.  
**Machine Learning Engineer Intern, Pulse Labs** – Improved Alexa/Google Assistant query handling with NLP/ML analysis.  
**Machine Learning Research Intern, Cobalt Speech** – Reduced ASR WER from 24% → 6% on noisy data and built NLU models for manufacturing systems.  
**Instructor, BYU** – Taught machine learning research methods, linear algebra (Python-based), and Calculus I.  

### 📄 Publications  
**[Decoupling the Backward Pass Using Abstracted Gradients](https://www.scitepress.org/PublicationsDetail.aspx?ID=/iTIAF48AyA=&t=1)** – ICAART 2024

[comment]: <> (One of my new year's resolution for 2025 is to commit at least one change to this github repo everyday, no exceptions. Hopefully this way, by the end of this year, this repository can turn into a portfolio that contains all of my past and present works.)

[comment]: <> (March 16 2025 I haven't been very dilligent in making good progress in updating my github the past couple weeks. Starting tomorrow, I will make it a priority again.)
