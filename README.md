## Hi, I'm Seong 👋

I’m a machine learning researcher and applied mathematician with experience bridging academic research and real-world AI applications. My work spans natural language processing, conversational AI, speech technologies, and generative modeling, with a strong foundation in applied mathematics (linear algebra, matrix calculus, probability theory, numerical analysis). I enjoy tackling complex problems at the intersection of theory and practice, from optimizing backpropagation methods to designing novel neural network architectures.

### 💻 Experience  
Since 2021, I have been a Graduate Researcher in the Machine Learning Research Group at BYU, where I co-authored a peer-reviewed paper (ICAART 2024) and led projects on backpropagation optimization, source separation, and novel language modeling approaches. I was also an Instructor at BYU, teaching machine learning research methods, linear algebra in Python, and Calculus. Previously, I was a Machine Learning Engineer Intern at Pulse Labs (2020–2021), where I analyzed Alexa and Google Assistant query data to improve user interactions, and a Research Intern at Cobalt Speech (2018), where I reduced ASR word error rate from 24% to 6% on noisy radio data and developed NLU models for manufacturing systems. Earlier in my career, I worked as an Undergraduate Researcher in applied mathematics, building ML models for graph eigenvalues and earthquake prediction.

[comment]: <> (One of my new year's resolution for 2025 is to commit at least one change to this github repo everyday, no exceptions. Hopefully this way, by the end of this year, this repository can turn into a portfolio that contains all of my past and present works.)

[comment]: <> (March 16 2025 I haven't been very dilligent in making good progress in updating my github the past couple weeks. Starting tomorrow, I will make it a priority again.)
