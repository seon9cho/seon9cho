      <td>A voice assistant that improves accuracy by asking clarifying questions before responding to user queries. The system learns unsupervised, requiring only user queries to generate clarifications dynamically. This approach reduces errors and ambiguity, enhancing user interactions without relying on predefined intent-response pairs.</td>

      <td>This work extends speech recognition problem by converting raw audio into discrete phonemes instead of direct language transcription. For classifying phonemes, several classical machine learning techniques such as dimensionality reduction is used with deep neural nets. Phoneme segmentation of raw audio is approached with reinforcement learning model.</td>

      <td>This research explores a novel approach to approximating eigenvalues by leveraging Isospectral Matrix Reduction and Gershgorinâ€™s Circle Theorem. By reducing a matrix while preserving its spectral properties and refining eigenvalue estimates using Gershgorin regions, this method offers an alternative perspective to traditional eigenvalue-solving algorithms.</td>
